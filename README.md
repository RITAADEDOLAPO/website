5. Difference between HTML and JSX
    i. In JSX, you must return a single parent or it wont compile but you can return more than one element in HTML.
    ii. In JSX, you can write JavaScript directly, by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {}, but in HTML,
        you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.
    iii. In JSX, you can't use 'class' and 'for' as they are reserved keyword, you can use 'className and 'HTMLfor', but in HTML, you can use 'class' and 'for'.

6. JSX is not valid JavaScript, browsers can't read it directly, they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React.
